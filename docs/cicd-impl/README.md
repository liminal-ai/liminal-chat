# CI/CD Implementation Documentation

## Overview

Complete CI/CD research and implementation plan for Liminal Chat, including Blacksmith GitHub Actions, Convex staging environment, Vercel deployment, WorkOS multi-environment setup, and PostHog analytics integration.

**Research Status**: COMPLETED  
**Implementation Status**: Ready to begin

## Quick Start

**Implementation Order**:
1. Blacksmith GitHub Actions (immediate 75% cost savings, 2x speed)
2. Convex Staging Environment (isolated backend testing)
3. WorkOS Multi-Environment Setup (authentication isolation)
4. Vercel Staging Environment (complete staging with custom domain)
5. PostHog Integration (analytics for innovative UI patterns)
6. Production Pipeline Optimization (monitoring, rollback procedures)

## Key Insights from Research

### Immediate Value
- **Blacksmith**: 75% cost savings, 2x speed improvement, drop-in replacement for GitHub Actions
- **PostHog**: 90%+ companies use free tier (1M events/month), perfect for innovative product measurement

### Architecture Benefits
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate Convex projects and WorkOS applications for staging vs production
- **Security**: Environment-specific deploy keys and credentials ensure proper separation
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability across GitHub Actions, Convex, Vercel, and WorkOS

### Cost Optimization
- Blacksmith provides immediate cost savings from day 1
- PostHog free tier eliminates analytics costs for most usage
- Usage-based pricing scales with actual need

## Implementation Context

This documentation was created after comprehensive research into CI/CD deployment planning for Liminal Chat. The project requires:

- **Multi-environment setup**: Development, staging, production isolation
- **Authentication management**: WorkOS across multiple environments  
- **Backend deployment**: Convex staging and production environments
- **Frontend deployment**: Vercel with custom staging domain
- **Performance optimization**: Blacksmith for faster, cheaper CI/CD
- **Analytics**: PostHog for measuring innovative multi-agent chat interface

## Technical Architecture

The implementation supports Liminal Chat's innovative features:
- **Multi-agent chat interface**: Single agent + roundtable conversations
- **Thread navigation**: Right-panel conversation branching (innovative UI pattern)
- **Folder organization**: Left-panel workspace with artifact materialization
- **Progressive enhancement**: Web-first with desktop readiness

## Next Steps

1. **Begin with Blacksmith** - Immediate benefits, minimal risk
2. **Follow implementation order** - Each step builds on previous components
3. **Use setup guides** - Detailed instructions for each service
4. **Monitor with contingency plans** - Prepared for common issues
5. **Add PostHog after staging** - Measure user interaction with innovative features
